determine local and external IP by entering (including ending dash):
wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -

you can set the iptable rules doing the following. Allowing the specific address through and dropping
all other ip's attempting to connect to port 22.
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 --source 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
